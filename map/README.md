==============

Places I've Lived & Travelled map. Built using [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/transition-from-mapbox-js-to-mapbox-gl-js/). 

I built this interactive map because I couldn't find an infographic template I liked.

What I worked on:

* Styled marker symbols with [Maki](https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/)

* Set zoom level and added caption and date popups with [Leaflet](http://www.leafletjs.com/index.html)

* Updated city coordinates
