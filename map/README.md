==============

Places I've Lived map. Built using [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/). 

I built this interactive map because I couldn't find an infographic template I liked.

What I worked on:

* Customized marker symbols in Mapbox.js

* Updated city coordinates

* Added caption text and dates

* Linked HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to display map
