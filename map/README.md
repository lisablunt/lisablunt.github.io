==============

Places I've Lived & Travelled map. Built using [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/). 

I built this interactive map because I couldn't find an infographic template I liked.

What I worked on:

* Styled marker symbols with [simplestyle](http://www.mapbox.com/help/define-simplestyle/)

* Set zoom level and added caption and date popups with [Leaflet](http://www.leafletjs.com/index.html)

* Updated city coordinates
